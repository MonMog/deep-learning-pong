# Future Work
Hello, the goal of this project is to train an AI agent using reinforcement learning to play pong efficiently. To start, I will be building Pong (hopefully) from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Once that is done, I will ponder on how to even think about the next steps.

Shoutout to the canvas, no need for importing other libraries for doing this. Now that the more basic game of Pong is done, its time to learn what reinforcement learning is and how to implement it to train these bad boys. I have currently hit a roadblock as I wanted to do this project in JS but the most updated resource for NEAT would be NEAT Python. Currently looking into my options and wondering how to execute this. I am using the Neataptic github repo and looking how previous examples used by it to understand how to morph it into my pong example.
